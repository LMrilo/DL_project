## Description
The notebook is unique, containing both training and testing of each model we tried to implement. The code is organized starting from the simplest techniques like MonteCarlo to reach some more complex ones like DQN implementing both feed forward neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
Alongside the notebook we provide a folder containing the agents derived from the training of the two DQN models and obvoiusly alist of all the necessary libraries to run the code.
